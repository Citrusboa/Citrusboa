- 👋 Hi, I’m Ivy AKA @Citrusboa. I'm relatively new to Github, but I'm excited to explore. 
- 👀 I’m interested in making cool personal projects and blogging in my spare time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of code, starting from C++ and Python. I'll be at the UWaterloo's ECE Engineering Program starting this fall 2021. I would love to build up my coding foundation on Github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a plethora of different projects. I'm open to anything and I'm always curious of what there is to do. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... ivybao07@gmail.com
